# Analog Clock

A simple analog clock implementation built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates basic web development concepts and provides a visually appealing and functional clock.

## Features
- Real-time clock display.
- Smooth hand movement for hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Responsive design suitable for various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the clock.
- **CSS**: Styling and animations for the clock hands.
- **JavaScript**: Logic to update the clock hands based on the current time.

## How to Use
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. The analog clock will display the current time automatically.
3. The clock updates in real-time without requiring a page refresh.

## File Structure
```
project-folder/
|-- index.html
|-- styles.css
|-- script.js
```
- **index.html**: Contains the clock layout and structure.
- **styles.css**: Defines the appearance of the clock, including the circular face and hands.
- **script.js**: Implements the logic for setting the positions of the clock hands based on the current time.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser.
3. View the analog clock in action.

- Provide customization options (e.g., themes, hand styles).
- Add time zone support to display different times.
- Include animations for smooth transitions.
